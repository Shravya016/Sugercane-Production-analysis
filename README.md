# Sugercane-Production-analysis
This project analyzes sugarcane production across continents through data cleaning, univariate and bivariate analysis, and correlation examination. By processing the dataset to ensure accuracy, exploring the distribution of sugarcane-producing countries, identifying key variables, and investigating correlations between factors influencing production, the project provides valuable insights for stakeholders. Findings highlight variations in production, key contributing factors, and implications for optimizing sugarcane cultivation practices globally, thereby contributing to informed decision-making and sustainable agricultural strategies.

Data Cleaning:
   - Cleaned and processed dataset to ensure accuracy and reliability.
    -Handled missing values, duplicates, and corrected data types.
   - Ensured consistency in the dataset.
Univariate Analysis:
   - Explored distribution of sugarcane-producing countries across continents.
   - Examined outliers and anomalies in the dataset.
   - Analyzed distribution of key variables: land area, yield per hectare, and production.
Bivariate Analysis:
   - Identified countries with maximum sugarcane production.
   - Determined countries with highest land area devoted to sugarcane cultivation.
    -Analyzed relationship between yield per hectare and total production.
Correlation Analysis:
   - Explored correlations between factors influencing sugarcane production.
   - Investigated if larger land areas correlate with higher sugarcane production.
   - Analyzed impact of yield per hectare on total production.
